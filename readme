TMS (Tool Management System) is a manufacturing tooling management system designed to manage the inventory, maintenance, and lifecycle of tools and dies, particularly in die casting or injection molding industries. The system covers inventory management, tooling engineering data (BOM and technical specifications), operational management, and comprehensive reporting. It enables lifecycle tracking, preventive and breakdown maintenance monitoring, tool replacement management, and data-driven analysis to improve production efficiency, reduce downtime, and extend tooling lifespan.
