This project is an e-RFI (Electronic Request for Investment) system developed to manage the investment request and approval process at PT TACI. The system supports end-to-end investment management, including RFI and ICR submission, multi-level approval workflows, budget planning and revisions, and progress tracking from approval to go-live. It integrates with enterprise systems such as EPS, OMS, and CIGMA to enable budget control, actual vs plan monitoring, and asset tracking. Built using CodeIgniter 3 with Microsoft SQL Server and MVC architecture, the system improves transparency, approval efficiency, and governance of corporate investment processes.
